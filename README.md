## Highlights

### Custom Stacked Ensemble Model
- **Five Base Models**: 
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - LightGBM Regressor
  - CatBoost Regressor
  - Artificial Neural Network (with TensorFlow)
  
- **Custom Stacking Logic**: Implemented a custom stacking mechanism to combine the predictions from the above models. This approach helps to reduce the model's bias and variance, leading to better generalization of unseen data.
- **Customized Loss Function for ANN**: Designed a unique loss function for the ANN to enhance performance on real estate data, effectively handling outliers and skewed distributions.
- **Customized Scoring Function for Optuna Study**: Created a custom scoring function in Optuna to optimize model hyperparameters, balancing key metrics like RMSE and RMSLE.

### Bayesian Optimization with Optuna
- Each model’s hyperparameters were fine-tuned using a **customized Optuna study** with a Bayesian optimization objective tailored to each model’s specific characteristics. This ensures that the models are optimized for the best performance.

### Performance Metrics
- **MSE**
- **RMSE**
- **RMSLE**
- **R² score** and **Adjusted R² score**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:



2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Open `Real Estate Stack.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis, train models, and generate predictions.

4. **Predict on Test Data**:

   You can use the trained models to predict prices for the properties in `test.csv` by running the final cells in the notebook.

## Results and Performance

- **Model Performance**: Evaluated using various metrics such as **RMSLE**, RMSE, and R² score. Detailed results, including visualizations and comparisons of different models, are provided in the notebook.
- **Final Accuracy**: The final stacked model achieved an RSMLE as low as 0.11 and, an R² score and an Adjusted R² both around 0.93 with a difference of less than 0.002! This means my feature engineering is terrific.
